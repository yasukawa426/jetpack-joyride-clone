## Game 2 - Jetpack Joyride

This time, instead of making a direct remake, I decided to make a game heavely inspired by it. Its Jetpack Joyride, but in a fantasy setting where a knight runs and dodges monsters. I had planned to add a lot more features and play around with some cool visual effects and stuff, but I decided I've already spent too much time on this game. I am sure if kept going, I would only keep finding even more features to add, so I'm gonna cut it here and move on lol.

### Gameplay

### Goals
- [x] Game world with a endlessly scrolling floor
- [x] Player character that falls when no input is held, but hises when the input is held
- [x] Endless obstacles that move from right to left (at least 1). Must be recycled or deleted when they leave the screen
- [x] Score and highscore that increases with distance. E.g.: 1000m
- [x] Add sound effects (footsteps, enemies attack sound)
### Bonus
- [x] Save highscore between sessions
- [ ] Shoot objects from player when flying
- [ ] Particle effects when destroing objects(?) - Killing enemies with our flying magic?
- [x] Add scaling difficulty based on score (faster scrolling, more timers?)
- [x] Add day/night cycle
- [ ] Add extra sound effect (music, ui interaction)
