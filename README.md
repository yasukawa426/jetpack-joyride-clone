## Game 2 - Jetpack Joyride

This time, instead of making a direct remake, I decided to make a game heavely inspired by it. I plan to use diferrent assets and different (to some extent) mechanics and obstacles

### Goals
- [x] Game world with a endlessly scrolling floor
- [x] Player character that falls when no input is held, but hises when the input is held
- [x] Endless obstacles that move from right to left (at least 1). Must be recycled or deleted when they leave the screen
- [x] Score and highscore that increases with distance. E.g.: 1000m
- [ ] Add sound effects (footsteps, enemies attack sound, music, death music, ui interaction?)
### Bonus
- [ ] Save highscore between sessions
- [ ] Shoot objects from player when flying
- [ ] Particle effects when destroing objects(?) - Killing enemies with our flying magic?
